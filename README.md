# PGE

PGE is a skeleton-first repo for bounded execution flow.

## Structure

```text
agents/
contracts/
skills/
```

- `agents/` — responsibility layer
- `contracts/` — handoff layer
- `skills/` — invocation layer

## Current skill
- `skills/pge-execute/SKILL.md`

## Normalized execution-core seams

For proving runs, the following files define the normative execution-core semantics:
- `agents/*.md` — role responsibilities
- `contracts/*.md` — handoff contracts
- `skills/pge-execute/SKILL.md` — invocation surface

These seams are the source of truth for runtime state, verdict, and routing decisions.

## Supporting reference docs

The following files provide richer governance guidance but must not override the normalized seams:
- [`phase-contract.md`](./phase-contract.md) — stronger planning guidance
- [`evaluation-gate.md`](./evaluation-gate.md) — richer evaluator guidance
- [`progress-md.md`](./progress-md.md) — progress consensus guidance

When proving the execution core, use these reference docs to enrich interpretation, but route/state/verdict vocabulary must follow the normalized contracts.
